\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}

It is generally useful for software to be able to programmatically determine
the capabilities of the hardware it is running on. External debuggers need to
know the same information. RISC-V extensions mostly use CSRs for this
information, but that is not flexible enough for some kinds of data like
hardware breakpoint capabilities, and cache hierarchy.

This document specifies syntax, semantics, discovery method, and access method
for a static data structure that can accommodate implementation parameters of
RISC-V standards beyond what can be easily put into CSRs. The structure is
called a Configuration Structure (CS).

\section{Goals}

\begin{steps}{The task group will deliver:}
\item A specification for a machine-readable format for the configuration
    structure. It's intended to be easily accessible by M-mode software and
    debuggers.
\item A specification for a human-readable format for the configuration
    structure. It's intended to be used to talk about the system description in
    this document as well as other documentation, to help designers write a
    configuration structure, and to display the configuration structure to
    people.
\item A software tool that translates back and forth between the
    machine-readable and human-readable format.
\item A specification for a method to discover and access, from M-mode
    software, the machine-readable configuration structures.
\end{steps}

The configuration structure should be flexible enough that future task groups
wonâ€™t feel the need to create another structure used to describe implementation
parameters. Implementation parameters are details that a RISC-V specification
explicitly leaves up to an implementation. This includes hart-specific details
like the kinds of hardware triggers supported, as well as details that are
outside harts such as the supported abstract debug commands.

\section{Use Cases}

\subsection{External Debuggers}

When an external debugger connects to a system, it would like to discover as
much as possible about that system in as little time as possible. Some of this
is merely to show the user (e.g. a manufacturer name), while other features are
critical to the user (e.g. XLEN), and other features determine what kind of
operations the user can perform (e.g. supported hardware trigger types). Most
of these are already discoverable, although many require writing a value and
checking the result to see whether support exists.

In the case of hardware trigger types there are so many possible combinations
of options that this is prohibitive. In other cases the software to detect all
features is quite complex. When some harts are powered down, no discovery is
possible on them at all. Supplying a system description can solve all these
problems.

\subsection{System Firmware}

Typical system firmware is executed when the system is powered on. It
initializes hardware, and builds up firmware services or data structures for
booting up system to OS. Examples are uboot for embedded systems, and BIOS for
PCs.

Throuh a combination of checking CSRs and
accessing the system description (Section~\ref{sec:AccessMethod}), firmware
can programmatically determine the hardware capabilities and configure hardware
accordingly.  These hardware capabilities can include availability and
implemented features of Physical Memory Protection (PMP), Core Local Interrupt
Controller (CLIC), Core Local Interruptor (CLINT), memory map, Platform-Level
Interrupt Controller (PLIC), Real Time Clock (RTC), reset mechanism, and any
future optional core features.

The Configuration Structure is an efficient alternative to testing for specific
hardware features (including handling failures) or customizing system firmware
for the specific system it will run on.

Often system firmware will take the information it has learned from the system
description as well as through other methods, and encode it into a different
industry-standard data structure (like Devicetree).  This structure is then
passed to the subsequent boot process.

The system firmware mentioned refers to startup software which is executed
when the system powers on. The system firmware initializes hardware configuration and
builds up firmware services or data structures for booting up system to OS. The typical
system firmware such as uboot for embedded systems, BIOS for PCs or other firmware
frameworks.

\chapter{Machine-Readable Format}

\begin{steps}{Ideas:}
\item Fully custom, along the lines of
    \url{https://github.com/riscv/riscv-debug-spec/pull/450/files#diff-9cee87c1f0feb10d9e3e9b2bfad92985R380}
\item Semi-custom, using CBOR
\item ...
\end{steps}

\chapter{Human-Readable Format}

\begin{steps}{Ideas:}
\item Take the binary format, and expand constants to strings, add whitespace,
keeping the mapping as close to 1:1 as possible.
\item XML
\item JSON
\item ...
\end{steps}

\chapter{Access Method}
\label{sec:AccessMethod}

\begin{steps}{Ideas:}
\item A CSR contains the base address of where the structure can be accessed on
the system bus
\item A CSR address/data pair can be used to access the structure. (Write index
to the address CSR, then read from the data CSR.)
\item ...
\end{steps}
